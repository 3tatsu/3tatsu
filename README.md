# Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm AtsumiFlex

## About Me
I am a passionate young FullStack developer, currently 16 years old. I started coding 5 years ago and have been continually improving and exploring new technologies ever since.

### ðŸ’» Languages and Tools:

- **SCSS**: For styling, SCSS is my go-to for its advanced capabilities that make CSS more powerful and organized.
- **Node.js**: An essential part of my development stack, Node.js allows me to build robust and efficient backend applications.

### ðŸš€ Current Projects:
Currently, I am working on creating an **ultimate discord**. This project aims to extend the functionalities of Discord and create an enhanced, personalized user experience.

### ðŸŒ± What I'm Learning Now:
I am always in pursuit of new skills and knowledge. Right now, I am focusing on deepening my backend development skills and learning new JavaScript/TypeScript libraries and frameworks.
